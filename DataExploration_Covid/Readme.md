**2020-2021 COVID-19 Data Exploration Using SQL**

**Overview**

This project explores global COVID-19 case within the years 2020-2021, death, and vaccination data to uncover trends and insights. It highlights the use of advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, window functions, temp tables, views) to analyze public health data and prepare outputs for visualization in Power BI/Tableau.

**Objectives**

- Analyze infection and death percentages across countries and continents
- Track vaccination progress over time
- Identify regions with the highest infection and mortality rates
- Build reusable SQL queries to support BI dashboards

**SQL Techniques**
- Aggregations: SUM, MAX, ROUND for case/death/vaccination metrics
- CTEs: To calculate rolling vaccination totals
- Window Functions: For cumulative trends over time
- Temp Tables: For intermediate population-vaccination calculations
- Views: To simplify BI integration
